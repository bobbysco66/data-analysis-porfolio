## About

Hi I'm Bobby! I have a technical background and hold a Masters of Engineering (M.Eng) degree in Chemical Engineering specializing in Process Control. I have worked as a Professional Engineer for over 5 years - collecting, cleaning, and analyzing data to drive positive business outcomes. Managed various projects ranging from optimizing maintenance programs to automating supply chain inventory categorization and debottlenecking complex processes in Operations. I have working knowledge of SQL, PowerBI, Python and R. I am currently seeking a more technology-focused role to derive meaningful insights from data to improve customer experience and optimize the base business. This a repository to showcase skills, share projects and track my progress in Data Analytics.
